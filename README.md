# Distance Computing

This project is used to compute the distance from a known object in an image to our camera.

To accomplish this task we utilized the triangle similarity, which requires us to know two important parameters prior to applying our algorithm:
 1. The width (or height) in some distance measure, such as inches or
    meters, of the object we are using as a marker.
 2. The distance (in inches or meters) of the camera to the marker in
    step 1.
 3. Computer vision and image processing algorithms can then be used to
    automatically determine the perceived width/height of the object in
    pixels and complete the triangle similarity and give us our focal
    length.
 4. Then, in subsequent images we simply need to find our marker/object
   and utilize the computed focal length to determine the distance to
   the object from the camera.
